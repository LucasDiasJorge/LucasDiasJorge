<h2>Hi, I'm Lucas Jorge 👋</h2>

<p>
  I'm a curious mind who believes in continuous learning, the power of software to create impact, and the beauty of simple, maintainable code.<br />
  From APIs and microservices to smart devices, I strive to bridge software and hardware in meaningful ways.

### 🌱 About Me

I'm a passionate backend developer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a strong drive to grow, improve, and make an impact through technology. I love digging deep into how things work, whether it's crafting a clean API, modeling scalable systems, or connecting software to the physical world through IoT.

Curiosity is what drives me — I'm constantly learning, exploring new technologies, and sharpening my skills. I find great satisfaction in writing clean, maintainable code and applying software engineering principles like SOLID and design patterns to build robust, scalable solutions.

Beyond the code, I believe in collaboration, knowledge sharing, and surrounding myself with people who challenge me to be better. My goal is simple: become a better version of myself every day — as a developer, as a teammate, and as a problem solver.
